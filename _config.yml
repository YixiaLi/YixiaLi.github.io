          - Extractive Document Q&A \
          Research on extractive long document Q&A system under open-domain.

          - Knowledge-enhanced Dialogue System \
          Research on the unreliability of responses caused by the knowledge shortage under open-domain.

          - Chinese ASR Entity Correction (will be to *ICASSP 2023*)\
          Research on ASR entity recognition error correction under the Chinese domain. A controlled decoding strategy based on domain-specific dictionaries is proposed. Experimental results on three publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.
